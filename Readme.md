# BTHome in Rust
This repo contains a library for working with [BTHome](https://bthome.io/) data and a utility to sniff BTHome BLE advertisments on Linux.

To be able to use it, you have to enable [experimental features](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bluetooth#Enabling_experimental_features) in bluez (I think).
